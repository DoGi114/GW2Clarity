## Installation

### Requirements:
You will need to install GW2 Addon Loader, instructions on installation found here: https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/loader-core#installation

> Alternatively, you may use the [Addon Manager](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/GW2-Addon-Manager) for an automated install

### Clarity:

Download the latest `gw2clarity.zip` from the **Assets** section found here: https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Clarity/releases/latest

Copy all files into `<Guild Wars 2 installation directory>/addons/gw2clarity/`.

## Usage

Configuration keybind is Alt+Shift+P. First create a Grid, then add buffs to the Grid. Grids can be assigned to Sets to quickly toggle which Grids are visible (e.g. to disable raid overlays in open world).

Currently unavailable in competitive modes.
